# text-editor-PWA-

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a text editor that runs in the browser that also functions as a PWA. The application also features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in the event one option is not supported. Primarily, IndexedDB was used. Lastly, the application will also function offline as well.
